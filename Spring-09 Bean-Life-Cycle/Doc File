There are three approaches for managing the bean life cycle in Spring
1. XML Configuration with init-method and destroy-method attributes:

In this approach, you specify initialization and destruction methods directly in the bean configuration XML file using the init-method and destroy-method attributes of the <bean> tag.

Advantages::
Explicitly declares initialization and destruction methods in the bean configuration.
Provides flexibility to specify different initialization and destruction methods for different beans.

Considerations::
It couples the bean configuration with the life cycle management, potentially making it harder to refactor or maintain.
The XML configuration may become verbose and hard to manage in large applications.

2. Implementing InitializingBean and DisposableBean interfaces:

In this approach, the bean class implements the InitializingBean and DisposableBean interfaces provided by Spring, which define methods to be executed during initialization and destruction, respectively.

Advantages::
It provides a standard way to define initialization and destruction logic within the bean class.
Centralizes the life cycle management within the bean class itself.

Considerations::
Tightly couples the bean class with Spring APIs, potentially reducing portability and testability.
Implementing Spring-specific interfaces may limit flexibility and integration with other frameworks.

3. Using Annotations: @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy:

With this approach, you annotate methods within the bean class with @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations, which indicate methods to be invoked after bean initialization and before bean destruction, respectively.
These above Annotations are the deprecated from java 9 and java 11 removed them
These are Part of the "Java EE"
To use them we need to use following Dependency

    <dependency>
	<groupId>javax.annotation</groupId>
	<artifactId>javax.annotation-api</artifactId>
	<version>1.3.2</version>
    </dependency>
	
and <context:annotation-config /> or  <bean class="org.springframework.context.annotation.CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor"/>
used to enable the above Annotations.

Advantages::
Offers a more lightweight and flexible alternative to implementing Spring interfaces or XML configuration.
Reduces coupling with Spring-specific APIs, enhancing portability and testability.

Considerations::
Requires the presence of the javax.annotation package, which may not be available in all environments.
Developers need to be aware of potential compatibility issues with older versions of Java EE or application servers.
