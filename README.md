# ===========================================

In main class we need to tell the IOC, collection the Information from the XML files.
To collect the information from XML by IOC there is two approaches
1) OLD Approach
   Need to import the required Packages
  {
   Resource resource = new ClassPathResource("Bean.xml");
   BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(resource);
   factory.getBean("object_Name", Class_Name.class);
  }

2) NEW Approach or Recently used :-
   Here also need to import the Packages
  {
   ApplicationContext app = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Bean.xml");
  }
   but when we use this NEW Approach then then we don't need explicitly call the object.

# =========================================

Constructor is get automatically Called whenever we creat it's Object.
